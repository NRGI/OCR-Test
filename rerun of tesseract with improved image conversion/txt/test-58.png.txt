Annex 3 H — capacity allocation principles

1 .

10.

A capacity assessment using a proven methodology will be undertaken to determine
"absolute daily capacity" (“Capacity").

Any portion oi Capacity allocated to a user (““User”) will be nominated “Allocated
Capacity”. A portion oi Capacity which is not used will be nominated “unallocated
Capacity".

The Concessionaire must make a register oi the Allocated Capacity and the Unallocated
Capacity (the ““Capacity Register”), keep it current and publish it at least twice per year.

When a Jser wants to be allocated a portion oi Capacity, it makes a request to the
Concessionaire, which allocates the Capacity on a ““iirst come, iirst sewed” basis.

lithe Unallocated Capacity is sui'licient tor the User requirements, the User will be allocated
such Capacity and will pay ior that Allocated Capacity.

Once Caoacity is allocated, and as long as the use oi the Capacity is being paid, the
capacity will remain allocated tor the entire duration oi a Users project.

Should there be insuiiicient, Unallocated Capacity to accommodate the User requirements,
he or the State will iund the necessary works to create additional Capacity (““Additiona|
Capacity”) and he will be allocated suiiicient oi this ior his requirements. He will pay ior that
Additiona Capacity and the charge will take account oi the manner in which the Additional
Capacity has been iunded, whether by the State or by the User.

The Addi ional Capacity allocated to the User will be nominated as Allocated Capacity and
recorded as such in the Capacity Register.

Any Addi ional Capacity not used by the User will be nominated as Unallocated Capacity
and recorded as such in the Capacity Register.

Any Unal ocated Capacity can be accessed by the Concessionaire on an ad—hoc basis tor
the beneiit oi all Users.
